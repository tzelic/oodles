# Oodles
There's oodles of things that need be ordered, and I ain't got no willpower to do it with Google Docs.

## Tentative models
### Oodler
A person who handles an office's stockpiles.

Has a `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, and an `office`

### Thingy
An orderable item, or an item from the stockpiles

Has a `name`, `unit`, `price`, and a `pictureUrl`

### Oodlet
A fancy name for an order

Has a `date`, `oodler`, `office`, `thingies [{...}, {...}, ...]`, and a  `total`
